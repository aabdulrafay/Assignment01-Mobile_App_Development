## 📌 Assignment Overview
This assignment focuses on understanding **Flutter state management** using `StatefulWidget` and practicing **Dart programming basics**.  

It is divided into **three tasks**:

### 🔹 Task 1: Flutter State Management (Bidding Page)
- Designed and implemented a **Bidding Page** using Flutter.  
- Displays the user’s **current maximum bid**.  
- When the **"Increase Bid"** button is tapped, the bid amount **increases by $50**.  
- Implemented using:
  - `MaximumBid` class → extends `StatefulWidget`  
  - `_MaximumBidState` class → manages state and handles bid increment

### 🔹 Task 2: Dart Basics (Input, Loops, Conditionals & Lists)
- Console-based Dart program that:  
  1. Takes **user’s name and age** as input.  
  2. If age < 18 → program prints *"Sorry [Name], you are not eligible to register."* and stops.  
  3. Otherwise, asks user how many numbers they want to enter.  
  4. Stores all numbers in a **list** and calculates:
     - Sum of even numbers  
     - Sum of odd numbers  
     - Largest number entered  
     - Smallest number entered  
  5. Prints the results clearly.

### 🔹 Task 3: Dart Loops & Patterns
- Console-based Dart program that takes an integer **n** as input and prints a **number pyramid pattern** using nested loops.  

**Example (n = 5):**
